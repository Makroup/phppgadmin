# Maintenance Policy

I have a 9-5 job, so I cannot devote my entire time to maintaining this project, but since I use it every day, I am quite invested in at least keeping it working.

# Contribution Policy

Contributions via pull request are most welcome. Code should be preferably formatted according to PSR-2, but I won't be too picky given the current state of affairs.
